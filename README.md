Things to do!
  1. make setting maxneurons limit the number of nodes in a network (some problems  like CartPole-v0 dont require a large number of         nodes), similar to setting a number of hidden layers. 
  2. modulize and remove global variables. 
  3. clean up tkinter display and make it pretty. I plan on organizing by number of links, so that nodes with a high link number are in     the center, surounded by les important nodes.  
  4. write docker container that inilizes open ai.
